# Overview
Vagrant/Salt configuration for automatically deploying a [FreeSWTICH](https://freeswitch.org) server.

The project strives to provide these three things:

 1. An easy way to get up and running with a local FreeSWITCH development environment
 2. A sane/convenient starting point for rolling a production server.
 3. A nice starter template for admins who want their FreeSWITCH server under Salt server configuration management.

## Installation

See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md).
